      <p>This was a solo coding project that I completed for CS 128 - Intro to Computer Science II. We were tasked with implementing 
        a completely functional Seam Carver program that could be ran in the terminal. This process involved writing multiple C++ 
        classes that handled storing image/pixel data in PPM files and arrays, implementing the carving algorithim itself (with separate 
        cases handling vertical and horizontal carves), and outputting the result to a new PPM file that could then be saved by the 
        user.
      </p>
      <p>Users could interact with this program by passing in arguments to the terminal including the image to be carved, the number of
        horizontal and vertical seams, and the output file.
